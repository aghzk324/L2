        <h1>Helu</h1>
        <p>Haha làm ơn đừng gào tui tại sao làm cái web đơn giản thế này =)).</p>
        <p>Alright, as we all know, we are moving to
       <a href="https://meowmewloveyou.neocities.org" target="_blank">THIS PAGE</a>.
       Please go and have a check!</p>

        <h1>Story:</h1>
        <p>This page was made for the Z and L memory card, included in ZtoL 4 or 5? I guess so.</p>
        <p>The original idea came from my dear friend. He showed me two coins, saying one is for you,
           and this coin represents the legend of our friendship. I thought, hmm interesting.
           So why not do the same with L? Something I can take everywhere, be with me in every event,
           witness my life and her life, as something for me to remember.</p>
        <p>So I made that card, using the technology I was once very proud of—one of the most durable
           and optimized products I ever mass-manufactured. A card that represents the best of my skill,
           a perfect blend of my skill sets.</p>
        <p>Another reason I chose the 3LA card super-durable series: just a little bit of equal diplomatic strategy I employed,
           matching with the enormous amount of work L put into her letters and handmade gifts for me!</p>
        <p>Side story: I cooked it up right the night before our trip. Using the wrong type of ink
           led to a slight fade over time, haiz.</p>
        <p>That day was also the first time our relationship became known to the majority of people,
           including my parents =))).</p>

          <figcaption>Z inside the blanket.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As we all know, that day was the night of the 10A1 trip. I failed the game and went out to check how L was doing.
           Uhm she opened some kind of “thịnh suy” song?? 😠. Alright, I sat there watching the movie with her, and bam—Tuan Minh’s mother (bác Hồng) kicked the door, and here we go: the picture.</p>
        <p>That night was fun. The second time we sat that close, and I’d say the first time we deep-talked that much too, and also sat together that late haha.</p>
        <p>Still old style—typed and not checked (actually GPT đid a quick cleanup). See ya at our new site!</p>
